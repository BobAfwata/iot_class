#integers are positive or negative whole numbers e.g.
age = 30 #does not require the user to speecify the data type i.e. int
print(age)

#in other languages int age = 30
#strongly typed

#float- positive or negative decimal point numbers/fractions/floating point numbers
distance = 12.67

a = 30
b = 40
c = 12.45
sum = a + b + c

name = "Gabriel"
height = 1.85 

# printf(" %d    %s " , age,name  )

#formatting in python

print("My name is {} and I am {} years old and I am {} metres tall ".format(name,age,height))
print(sum)

#characters include alphanumeric characters (a,b,c...z) numerals (0-9), special characters(#$%^@)
grade = 'A'

#strings- collection/group of characters
name = "Maggie"

# to add strings together, we concatenate
f_name = "Bob"
s_name = "Afwata"
full_name = f_name + " " + s_name
print(full_name)
